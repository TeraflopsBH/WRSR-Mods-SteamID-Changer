## Introduction

As its title says, it makes it easy for user to mass-change SteamID for mods in `workshop_wip` folder

When run for the first time, it makes `config.ini` file where it stores SteamID you provide and location of the folder where mods reside.

User is presented by a simple menu where he can opt to enter SteamID and specify the mod folder.
After completing that, user is presented with options to:
- mass-update all mods in `workshop_wip` folder with SteamID he provided
- change/update SteamID stored in `config.ini` file
- change mods folder location stored in `config.ini` file

and to `Exit`, of course :)

If you have python installed on Windows, you can execute it by:
```bash
ptyhon WRSRModSteamIDChanger.py
````
if you prefer using Windows standalone executable `EXE` file, feel free to do so by executing `WRSRModSteamIDChanger.exe`
